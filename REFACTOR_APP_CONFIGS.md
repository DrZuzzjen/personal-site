# üèóÔ∏è REFACTOR: Centralized App Configuration System

**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** HIGH (Fixes production bug + improves architecture)
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Branch:** `refactor/centralized-app-configs`

---

## üìã Problem Statement

**Current Bug:** Paint.exe opens with inconsistent window sizes depending on how it's launched:
- Desktop icon: 800√ó600 ‚úÖ (correct)
- Terminal command: 520√ó420 ‚ùå (too small)
- MSN Messenger: 520√ó420 ‚ùå (too small)

**Root Cause:** App configurations are duplicated in 3 different files:
1. `app/components/Desktop/DesktopIcon.tsx` (lines 45-50, 97-112)
2. `app/components/Apps/Terminal/commands/apps.ts` (lines 23-167)
3. `app/components/Apps/Chatbot/Chatbot.tsx` (lines 80-185)

**Impact:**
- User Experience: Paint opens unusably small from Terminal/MSN
- Maintainability: Adding/updating apps requires editing 3 files
- Data Integrity: Configurations drift out of sync

---

## üéØ Solution: Option 3 - Centralized App Registry

Create a **single source of truth** for all application metadata in a new file: `app/lib/app-configs.ts`

This registry will contain:
- Window dimensions (width, height)
- Default positions (x, y)
- Window icons
- App titles
- Initial content/props specific to each app

All 3 callers (Desktop, Terminal, MSN) will import from this central registry.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

### 1. New File: `app/lib/app-configs.ts`

**Location:** `/Users/franzuzz/Documents/GitHub/personal-site/app/lib/app-configs.ts`

**Purpose:** Centralized registry of all app configurations

**Structure Requirements:**
- Export a named constant called `APP_CONFIGS`
- Use a Record type mapping app names to configuration objects
- Include TypeScript types for type safety
- Each app config should have:
  - `title` (string)
  - `defaultSize` (object with width/height numbers)
  - `defaultPosition` (object with x/y numbers)
  - `icon` (string)
  - `defaultContent` (optional object, varies by app type)

**Apps to Include (ALL):**
1. paint
2. minesweeper
3. notepad
4. snake
5. camera
6. tv
7. browser (Internet Explorer)
8. chatbot (MSN Messenger)
9. portfolio
10. terminal
11. explorer (File Explorer)
12. mycomputer

**Dimension Requirements (use current CORRECT values):**

**From DesktopIcon.tsx (these are the CORRECT reference values):**
- Paint: 800√ó600
- Minesweeper: 360√ó440
- Notepad: 520√ó380
- Snake: 850√ó580
- Camera: 720√ó580
- TV: 880√ó720
- Browser: 960√ó720
- Chatbot (MSN): 480√ó620
- Portfolio: 750√ó863

**From Terminal/apps.ts (these need verification - some may be correct for terminal-specific launches):**
- Terminal: 800√ó600
- Explorer: 520√ó360

**Important Notes:**
- The dimensions in DesktopIcon.tsx should be considered the canonical reference
- If Terminal/Chatbot have different values, they are likely bugs (verify each app)
- Position coordinates should use smart defaults (staggered, not all overlapping)

---

### 2. Update File: `app/components/Desktop/DesktopIcon.tsx`

**Changes Required:**

**Remove:**
- All individual constant declarations like:
  - `NOTEPAD_WINDOW_SIZE`
  - `MINESWEEPER_WINDOW_SIZE`
  - `PAINT_WINDOW_SIZE`
  - `CAMERA_WINDOW_SIZE`
  - `TV_WINDOW_SIZE`
  - `BROWSER_WINDOW_SIZE`
  - (Lines 45-50 approximately)

**Remove:**
- All individual `createXLaunch()` functions:
  - `createPaintLaunch()`
  - `createMinesweeperLaunch()`
  - `createNotepadLaunch()`
  - `createSnakeLaunch()`
  - `createCameraLaunch()`
  - `createTVLaunch()`
  - `createChatbotLaunch()`
  - `createPortfolioLaunch()`
  - `createBrowserLaunch()`
  - (Lines 97-219 approximately)

**Add:**
- Import statement at top of file to get `APP_CONFIGS` from the new file
- Create a single generic helper function that:
  - Takes an app name (string)
  - Looks up the config from `APP_CONFIGS`
  - Returns a properly structured `LaunchConfig` object
  - Handles special cases like passing file content to notepad

**Update:**
- The `getLaunchConfigForFile()` function to use the new helper instead of individual create functions
- Keep the existing double-click and file-handling logic intact
- Ensure all app types still work correctly

**Testing Points:**
- Double-clicking desktop icons should open apps with correct dimensions
- File associations should still work (txt files open notepad)
- Protected files should still show as read-only

---

### 3. Update File: `app/components/Apps/Terminal/commands/apps.ts`

**Changes Required:**

**Remove:**
- The entire `APP_LAUNCHERS` array (lines 23-167)
- The `LaunchDefinition` interface (only if not needed elsewhere)

**Add:**
- Import statement at top to get `APP_CONFIGS` from the new file

**Update:**
- The `findLauncher()` function to work with the new config structure
  - Should match app names/aliases from the new registry
  - Each app in the new registry should include an `aliases` array for matching
- The `run` command execute function to:
  - Look up configs from `APP_CONFIGS`
  - Use the centralized dimensions instead of hardcoded values
  - Preserve the random position logic (`getRandomPosition()`)
  - Keep all existing command functionality (--list flag, path resolution)

**Testing Points:**
- Terminal commands should work: `run paint.exe`, `run minesweeper`, etc.
- `run --list` should show all available apps
- Apps should open with correct (larger) dimensions
- Position randomization should still work

---

### 4. Update File: `app/components/Apps/Chatbot/Chatbot.tsx`

**Changes Required:**

**Remove:**
- The entire `configs` object inside `getAppConfig()` function (lines 87-185)

**Add:**
- Import statement at top to get `APP_CONFIGS` from the new file

**Update:**
- The `getAppConfig()` function to:
  - Look up the app config from `APP_CONFIGS` by name
  - Return the same structure as before (title, appType, position, size, icon, content)
  - Keep the existing type signature (don't break callers)
  - Use the centralized dimensions

**Keep:**
- All MSN Messenger UI logic
- Sound effects and chat functionality
- Action execution logic (openApp, closeApp, restart)

**Testing Points:**
- MSN Messenger should be able to open apps via chat commands
- "abre paint" should open Paint with correct dimensions
- All supported app names should work
- Position handling should work correctly

## üö® Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1:** Breaking existing functionality
- **Mitigation:** Test thoroughly after each file update, commit incrementally

**Risk 2:** TypeScript type mismatches
- **Mitigation:** Define proper types in the new file first, ensure consuming code matches

**Risk 3:** Missing edge cases (special content handling)
- **Mitigation:** Review each app's current content structure, preserve special cases in new config

**Risk 4:** Position randomization conflicts
- **Mitigation:** Keep Terminal's random position logic separate from centralized configs

---

## üìö Reference: Current Dimension Mismatches

| App | Desktop | Terminal | MSN | Status |
|-----|---------|----------|-----|--------|
| Paint | 800√ó600 | 520√ó420 | 520√ó420 | ‚ùå BUG |
| Minesweeper | 360√ó440 | 360√ó320 | 360√ó320 | ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFY |
| Notepad | 520√ó380 | 480√ó320 | 480√ó320 | ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFY |
| Snake | 850√ó580 | 860√ó600 | 860√ó600 | ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFY |
| Camera | 720√ó580 | 720√ó580 | 720√ó580 | ‚úÖ MATCH |
| TV | 880√ó720 | 880√ó720 | 800√ó600 | ‚ö†Ô∏è MSN WRONG |
| Browser | 960√ó720 | 960√ó720 | 900√ó650 | ‚ö†Ô∏è MSN WRONG |
| Chatbot | 480√ó620 | 500√ó640 | 600√ó500 | ‚ö†Ô∏è ALL DIFFERENT |
| Portfolio | 750√ó863 | 900√ó700 | - | ‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFY |

**Decision Rule:** When dimensions conflict, use DesktopIcon.tsx values as canonical (they were carefully designed for the actual app content).

## üí° Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

These are NOT part of this refactor but could be future improvements:
- Add window resize limits (minWidth, maxWidth, etc.)
- Add app categories/tags for better organization
- Add launch animations or transition configs
- Support per-app themes or color schemes
- Add keyboard shortcuts per app

---

## üìû Questions for Developer

Before starting implementation, developer should clarify:

1. **Notepad special case:** Should notepad's content handling be part of the centralized config or stay as a special case in the consuming code?

2. **Position strategy:** Should positions be centralized or keep the current mix (Desktop uses fixed positions, Terminal uses random)?

3. **Minesweeper content:** The minesweeper config includes game settings (rows, cols, mines). Should this be in the central config or passed separately?

4. **Backwards compatibility:** Are there any external consumers of these functions that we need to preserve?

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

This refactor is complete when:
- [ ] New `app-configs.ts` file exists with all app configurations
- [ ] All 3 consuming files import from the central registry
- [ ] Paint.exe opens at 800√ó600 from Terminal (bug fixed)
- [ ] Paint.exe opens at 800√ó600 from MSN (bug fixed)
- [ ] All apps work from all launch methods
- [ ] TypeScript build succeeds with no errors
- [ ] All tests pass (manual testing checklist above)
- [ ] No code duplication of window dimensions
- [ ] PR is reviewed and merged to master
