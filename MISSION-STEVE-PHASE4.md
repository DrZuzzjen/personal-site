# Mission Briefing - Steve (Boot Sequence Team)

**Your Role**: Boot Animation Developer - Phase 4
**Working**: Solo (no parallel developer this time!)
**Branch**: `feature/phase4-boot-sequence`
**Priority**: üü¢ MEDIUM - Fun creative task!
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours autonomous execution

---

## üéØ Your Mission: Boot Sequence

**Goal**: Create an immersive Windows 3.1 boot animation that plays before the desktop loads.

This is a **fun, creative task** - make it authentic, funny, and nostalgic!

---

## üìã Improved Communication Protocol

### ‚úÖ Lessons from Phase 3:

**What worked great:**
- ‚úÖ Frequent commits (after each file)
- ‚úÖ Your detailed final commit message was AMAZING!
- ‚úÖ Clean component separation

**New additions for Phase 4:**

### 1. **Commit Message Format**

**ALL commits must start with `[STEVE]`:**

```bash
git commit -m "[STEVE] feat(boot): add POST screen component"
git commit -m "[STEVE] feat(boot): add memory check animation"
git commit -m "[STEVE] fix(boot): adjust timing intervals"
```

**Why?** Makes it easy to identify your work in git log.

---

### 2. **Progress Updates in Commits**

**After completing each major component, write a detailed commit message:**

```bash
git commit -m "[STEVE] feat(boot): complete POST screen

Built:
- POST screen with black background
- White monospace text
- Animated memory check
- Funny easter egg messages

Technical details:
- Used setTimeout for sequential animations
- Stored boot messages in constants
- Clean component lifecycle

Next: Building Windows loading screen"
```

**This helps:**
- Claude (me) track your progress
- Future developers understand your decisions
- Document what was built and why

---

### 3. **Communication via Commit Comments**

**If you have questions or want to leave notes:**

```bash
git commit -m "[STEVE] feat(boot): add loading animation

QUESTION @claude: Should loading bar be smooth or chunky/retro?
NOTE: Used CSS animation instead of JS for performance
TODO: Add skip button in next commit"
```

I'll read your commits and can respond by:
- Leaving comments in code reviews
- Creating a `RESPONSE-STEVE.md` file
- Updating PHASES.md with answers

---

## üé® What You're Building

### Component Architecture:

```
app/components/BootSequence/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BootSequence.tsx        (Main orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PostScreen.tsx          (Power-On Self-Test screen)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MemoryCheck.tsx         (Memory counting animation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LoadingScreen.tsx       (Windows loading with progress)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                (Exports)
```

**Plus:**
- Update `app/page.tsx` to show boot on first load
- Add boot messages to `app/lib/constants.ts`
- Optional: Add localStorage flag to skip boot on subsequent visits

---

## üì¶ Component Requirements

### Component 1: BootSequence (Orchestrator)

**File**: `app/components/BootSequence/BootSequence.tsx`

**What it should do:**
- Orchestrate the entire boot sequence
- Show components in order: POST ‚Üí Memory ‚Üí Loading ‚Üí Desktop
- Handle timing between screens
- Manage state: which screen is showing?
- Callback when boot completes (shows desktop)

**Flow:**
```
1. PostScreen (3 seconds)
   ‚Üì
2. MemoryCheck (3 seconds)
   ‚Üì
3. LoadingScreen (2 seconds)
   ‚Üì
4. onBootComplete() ‚Üí Show Desktop
```

**Props:**
```typescript
interface BootSequenceProps {
  onBootComplete: () => void;
  skipBoot?: boolean; // If true, immediately call onBootComplete
}
```

**Think about:**
- How to sequence screens? (useState + useEffect + setTimeout?)
- Should transitions be instant or fade?
- How to handle skip button?
- Should boot be skippable by pressing any key?

---

### Component 2: POST Screen

**File**: `app/components/BootSequence/PostScreen.tsx`

**What it should do:**
- Black screen with white monospace text
- Display BIOS-style messages
- Simulate hardware detection
- Show "Press any key to continue..." at end

**Visual:**
```
Phoenix BIOS v3.1.0
Copyright (C) 1985-1992 Phoenix Technologies Ltd.

Detecting hardware...
  CPU: Intel 80486DX @ 33MHz
  RAM: 4096 KB OK

Press any key to continue...
```

**Messages to display** (get from constants):
- BIOS header
- CPU detection
- RAM check
- Creative funny messages (from BOOT_MESSAGES in constants)

**Animation:**
- Type messages line-by-line? Or show all at once?
- Blinking cursor at the end?
- Classic PC beep sound (optional, might be annoying!)

**Think about:**
- Should text appear instantly or animate in?
- How long should each line take?
- Keep it fast enough not to bore users!

---

### Component 3: Memory Check

**File**: `app/components/BootSequence/MemoryCheck.tsx`

**What it should do:**
- Show memory counting from 0 to 4096 KB
- Display funny messages during check
- Windows 3.1 style formatting

**Visual:**
```
Testing memory...

Memory: 1024 KB
Detecting creativity... FOUND
Loading personality drivers... OK

Memory: 2048 KB
Initializing humor.dll... SUCCESS
Calibrating mouse... DOUBLE-CLICK DETECTED

Memory: 4096 KB OK
```

**Easter Egg Messages** (from constants):
- "Detecting creativity... FOUND"
- "Loading personality drivers... OK"
- "Initializing humor.dll... SUCCESS"
- "Calibrating mouse... DOUBLE-CLICK DETECTED"
- "Mounting resume.pdf... READY"
- etc.

**Think about:**
- Should memory count up smoothly or in chunks?
- How fast should it count?
- Show progress bar or just numbers?
- Mix in easter egg messages between memory updates?

---

### Component 4: Loading Screen

**File**: `app/components/BootSequence/LoadingScreen.tsx`

**What it should do:**
- Classic "Loading Windows..." screen
- Progress bar or dots animation
- Windows 3.1 logo (optional - can be text)
- Final screen before desktop appears

**Visual:**
```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ                         ‚îÇ
‚îÇ    Microsoft Windows    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ         3.1             ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                         ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   Loading Windows...    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ   ................      ‚îÇ
‚îÇ                         ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Animation options:**
- Dots appearing one by one: `...` ‚Üí `....` ‚Üí `.....`
- Progress bar filling up
- "Please wait" message
- Spinning cursor?

**Think about:**
- Should it look like real Windows 3.1 or stylized?
- How long should this screen show?
- Fade out to desktop or instant switch?

---

## üé® Design Guidelines

### Visual Style:

**POST Screen:**
- Black background (#000000)
- White text (#FFFFFF)
- Monospace font (Courier or similar)
- Text size: 14px
- Line height: 1.5

**Memory Check:**
- Black background
- White text
- Show numbers incrementing
- Easter egg messages in different color? (green/cyan for success)

**Loading Screen:**
- Gray background (#C0C0C0) or keep black
- Centered content
- Windows 3.1 logo style
- Progress indicator

### Timing:

**Suggested timings** (you can adjust):
- POST Screen: 3 seconds
- Memory Check: 3 seconds (counting animation)
- Loading Screen: 2 seconds
- Total boot time: ~8 seconds

**Too long?** Users might get bored. Too short? Loses the nostalgia effect.

**Your call!** Find the sweet spot.

---

## üîß Integration Points

### Constants to Add:

**File**: `app/lib/constants.ts`

Add a new section:

```typescript
// (Add this somewhere in constants.ts)

export const BOOT_SEQUENCE = {
  POST_MESSAGES: [
    'Phoenix BIOS v3.1.0',
    'Copyright (C) 1985-1992 Phoenix Technologies Ltd.',
    '',
    'Detecting hardware...',
    '  CPU: Intel 80486DX @ 33MHz',
    '  RAM: 4096 KB OK',
    '',
    'Press any key to continue...',
  ],

  EASTER_EGG_MESSAGES: [
    'Detecting creativity... FOUND',
    'Loading personality drivers... OK',
    'Initializing humor.dll... SUCCESS',
    'Calibrating mouse... DOUBLE-CLICK DETECTED',
    'Mounting resume.pdf... READY',
    'Installing confidence.sys... 100%',
    'Scanning for coffee... NOT FOUND (please provide)',
  ],

  LOADING_MESSAGES: [
    'Loading Windows 3.1...',
    'Initializing workspace...',
    'Preparing desktop environment...',
    'Almost there...',
  ],

  TIMINGS: {
    POST_SCREEN: 3000,      // 3 seconds
    MEMORY_CHECK: 3000,     // 3 seconds
    LOADING_SCREEN: 2000,   // 2 seconds
  },
} as const;
```

**You decide:** What messages to use, how to structure it, what timings feel right.

---

### Page Integration:

**File**: `app/page.tsx`

Add boot sequence logic:

**Approach 1: Always show boot**
```typescript
const [bootComplete, setBootComplete] = useState(false);

if (!bootComplete) {
  return <BootSequence onBootComplete={() => setBootComplete(true)} />;
}

return <Desktop>...</Desktop>
```

**Approach 2: Show boot only on first visit**
```typescript
const [hasBooted, setHasBooted] = useState(() => {
  return localStorage.getItem('hasBooted') === 'true';
});

useEffect(() => {
  if (hasBooted) {
    localStorage.setItem('hasBooted', 'true');
  }
}, [hasBooted]);

if (!hasBooted) {
  return <BootSequence onBootComplete={() => setHasBooted(true)} />;
}
```

**You decide:** What makes sense for the portfolio experience?

## üìù Commit Strategy

**Format: `[STEVE] type(scope): message`**

```bash
# After creating PostScreen
git add app/components/BootSequence/PostScreen.tsx
git commit -m "[STEVE] feat(boot): add POST screen with BIOS messages

Built classic POST screen:
- Black background with white monospace text
- Phoenix BIOS header
- Hardware detection messages
- 'Press any key to continue' prompt

Used constants for all messages (BOOT_SEQUENCE.POST_MESSAGES)"
git push origin feature/phase4-boot-sequence

# After MemoryCheck
git pull origin feature/phase4-boot-sequence
git add app/components/BootSequence/MemoryCheck.tsx
git commit -m "[STEVE] feat(boot): add memory check with easter eggs

Memory counting animation:
- Counts from 0 to 4096 KB
- Shows easter egg messages during check
- Green text for success messages

QUESTION @claude: Is 3 seconds too slow for memory check?"
git push origin feature/phase4-boot-sequence

# etc...
```

**Remember:**
- Commit after EACH component file
- Pull before pushing (even though you're solo, good habit!)
- Write detailed messages for major components
- Use QUESTION/NOTE/TODO for communication

---

## üí° Creative Freedom

**This is YOUR canvas!**

I'm giving you requirements, but you have creative freedom:

- Choose the exact messages (make them funny!)
- Pick the timing (fast? slow? dramatic?)
- Decide on animations (smooth? retro chunky?)
- Add bonus features (sound? skip button? easter eggs?)

**Make it nostalgic and fun!** üéâ
