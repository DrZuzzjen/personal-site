# Mission 2F: Fix Premature Email Tool Call

## Problem
Agent is calling `validateAndSendEmail` tool with invalid data (`"email": "unknown"`) before collecting actual customer information, causing validation errors and 500 responses.

## Evidence from Testing

### Test Input (Spanish)
```
User: "Hola amigo me intesa comprar un sitio web"
```

### What Happened
```
[chat-v2] Extracted fields: {
  name: null,
  email: null,
  projectType: 'sitio web',  // ‚úÖ Correctly extracted
  budget: null,
  timeline: null
}

Error: tool call validation failed: parameters for tool validateAndSendEmail
did not match schema: errors: [`/email`: 'unknown' is not valid 'email']

Failed tool call:
{
  "name": "unknown",
  "email": "unknown",        // ‚ùå Invalid - fails Zod .email() validation
  "projectType": "sitio web",
  "budget": "unknown",
  "timeline": "unknown",
  "conversationHistory": "[...]"
}
```

### What SHOULD Happen
Agent should respond: "¬°Perfecto! Un sitio web üòä ¬øC√≥mo te llamas?" (asking for name)

## Root Cause

The agent is calling the tool despite having `null` values in the extracted fields. The prompt in [sales-agent-en.txt:24](app/lib/ai/prompts/sales-agent-en.txt#L24) says:

> "When you have name + email + projectType ‚Üí send email immediately"

But it's not explicit enough about what "have" means. The agent is interpreting missing fields as "unknown" and trying to send anyway.

## Solution

### Fix 1: Update Sales Agent Prompt
Strengthen [sales-agent-en.txt](app/lib/ai/prompts/sales-agent-en.txt) to be more explicit:

```txt
TOOL USAGE - CRITICAL RULES:
‚ùå NEVER call validateAndSendEmail if ANY required field is missing/null
‚ùå NEVER use placeholder values like "unknown", "N/A", or empty strings
‚úÖ ONLY call validateAndSendEmail when you have REAL values for: name, email, projectType

VALIDATION BEFORE CALLING TOOL:
- name: Must be an actual name (not null, not "unknown")
- email: Must be a valid email with @ symbol (not null, not "unknown")
- projectType: Must be what they want to build (not null, not "unknown")

IF ANY FIELD IS MISSING:
1. Ask for the FIRST missing required field
2. Wait for customer response
3. Do NOT call the tool yet

EXAMPLE FLOW:
User: "I want a website"
‚Üí You: "Awesome! üé® What's your name?"
[DO NOT call tool yet - missing name and email]

User: "John"
‚Üí You: "Nice to meet you John! What's your email?"
[DO NOT call tool yet - missing email]

User: "john@gmail.com"
‚Üí Now you have: name=John, email=john@gmail.com, projectType=website
‚Üí NOW call validateAndSendEmail tool
```

Replace the existing "TOOL USAGE:" section (lines 36-39) with the above text.

### Fix 2: Add Safety Check in Sales Agent Constructor
Add validation in [sales-agent.ts](app/lib/ai/agents/sales-agent.ts) to prevent premature tool calls:

```typescript
private buildSystemPrompt(fieldStatus: string): string {
  const basePrompt = PROMPTS.SALES_AGENT(fieldStatus);

  // Add explicit safety instructions at the end
  const safetyNote = `

CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK - READ CAREFULLY:
Before calling validateAndSendEmail, verify:
1. name is NOT null and NOT "unknown" ‚Üí ask "What's your name?" if missing
2. email is NOT null and NOT "unknown" ‚Üí ask "What's your email?" if missing
3. projectType is NOT null and NOT "unknown" ‚Üí already extracted from conversation

If ANY of the above is null/"unknown", DO NOT call the tool. Ask for the missing field instead.
`;

  return basePrompt + safetyNote;
}
```

Update the method call in constructor (line 21):
```typescript
const systemPrompt = this.buildSystemPrompt(fieldStatus);
```

### Fix 3: Improve Tool Description
Update [email-tool.ts:57-70](app/lib/ai/agents/tools/email-tool.ts#L57) to be more explicit:

```typescript
description: `Validate customer fields and send sales inquiry email to Fran.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: ONLY call this tool when you have REAL VALUES for all 3 required fields.

WHEN TO USE:
‚úÖ You have actual name (not null, not "unknown")
‚úÖ You have valid email with @ symbol (not null, not "unknown")
‚úÖ You have projectType (not null, not "unknown")
‚úÖ Budget/timeline are optional - can be "I don't know" or any answer

WHEN NOT TO USE:
‚ùå ANY required field is null
‚ùå ANY required field is "unknown" or placeholder value
‚ùå Email doesn't have @ symbol
‚ùå Name is too short (< 2 chars)

IF FIELDS ARE MISSING:
‚Üí Ask the customer for the missing information
‚Üí Do NOT call this tool with placeholder values

WHAT IT DOES:
1. Validates required fields are present and correctly formatted
2. Sends email to Fran with the customer inquiry
3. Returns success or failure details`,
```

## Testing Plan

### Test Case 1: Single Message with All Info
```
Input: "Hi, I'm John (john@gmail.com) and I want a website"
Expected:
- Extract all 3 fields
- Call tool immediately
- Success
```

### Test Case 2: Incremental Collection (MAIN TEST)
```
Input 1: "Hola amigo me intesa comprar un sitio web"
Expected: Agent asks "¬øC√≥mo te llamas?" (What's your name?)
Verify: Tool NOT called, no error

Input 2: "Joaquin Fernanzes"
Expected: Agent asks "¬øCu√°l es tu email?" (What's your email?)
Verify: Tool NOT called, no error

Input 3: "joa@gmail.com"
Expected: Tool called with valid data, email sent
Verify: Tool called successfully, no validation errors
```

### Test Case 3: Partial Info
```
Input: "I want to build an app"
Expected: Agent asks "What's your name?"
Verify: Tool NOT called (missing name + email)
```

## Files to Modify
1. [app/lib/ai/prompts/sales-agent-en.txt](app/lib/ai/prompts/sales-agent-en.txt) - Strengthen tool usage rules
2. [app/lib/ai/agents/sales-agent.ts](app/lib/ai/agents/sales-agent.ts) - Add safety check in prompt builder
3. [app/lib/ai/agents/tools/email-tool.ts](app/lib/ai/agents/tools/email-tool.ts) - Improve tool description

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent NEVER calls tool with "unknown" or null values
- [ ] Agent asks for missing required fields one at a time
- [ ] Spanish test case passes (incremental collection)
- [ ] No validation errors in logs
- [ ] All 3 test cases pass

## Priority
**HIGH** - Blocking E2E testing. Agent is unusable in current state.

## Notes
This is a prompt engineering issue - the agent needs clearer instructions about WHEN to call the tool vs WHEN to ask for more info. The tool schema validation is working correctly by rejecting invalid data.
