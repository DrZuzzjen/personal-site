# Bugs & Enhancements Tracker

## üêõ Known Bugs

### 1. Desktop Right-Click "New" Submenu Not Showing
**Issue**: Right-click desktop ‚Üí "New" option exists but submenu doesn't appear
**Expected**: Should show submenu with "Text Document", "Folder", maybe "Image"
**Current State**: Folder/File CRUD functions exist, just UI not wired
**Fix**: Wire up context menu to show submenu options

### 2. Paint UI Needs Major Overhaul
**Issue**: Paint looks rough - buttons cramped, canvas too small, poor spacing
**Problems**:
- Toolbar buttons too small and tight
- Canvas size too small relative to window
- Colors/tools hard to see
- Overall layout feels amateur
**Fix**: Redesign Paint UI with better spacing, larger canvas, clearer buttons

## üöÄ Enhancements Needed

### 1. Drag Files from FileExplorer to Desktop
**Feature**: Drag .txt files from My Documents to Desktop (like real Windows)
**Current**: Files only exist in FileExplorer, can't drag to desktop
**Requirements**:
- Drag file item from FileExplorer window
- Drop on Desktop creates desktop icon for that file
- Double-click desktop icon opens file in Notepad
- Should work with any file type

**Technical Notes**:
- FileExplorer items need drag handlers
- Desktop needs drop zone
- Create desktop icon on drop
- Link icon to file path in FileSystemContext

**Priority**: High (feels very authentic Windows)

## üîß Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add PropTypes or better TypeScript validation
- [ ] Extract common button styles to shared components
- [ ] Centralize z-index values (currently scattered)
- [ ] Add error boundaries for app components

### Performance
- [ ] Lazy load app components (don't render until window opens)
- [ ] Optimize canvas re-renders in Paint
- [ ] Debounce drag operations if laggy
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large file lists

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for hooks (useWindowManager, useFileSystem)
- [ ] Integration tests for file operations
- [ ] E2E tests for critical flows (boot ‚Üí open app ‚Üí save file)

**Priority**: Post-launch
