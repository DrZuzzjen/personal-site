## How to Use This Document

1. **Check off tasks** as you complete them (edit this file)
2. **Add notes** below tasks if needed (blockers, decisions, etc.)
3. **Update "Current Phase"** at the top when moving to next phase
4. **Communicate**: If you start a task, mark it with `[WIP]` so we don't duplicate work

Example:
```markdown
- [WIP] Window Component (Claude working on this)
- [x] Window Manager Hook (Completed - ready for review)
- [ ] Desktop Component (Blocked: waiting for Window System)
```
