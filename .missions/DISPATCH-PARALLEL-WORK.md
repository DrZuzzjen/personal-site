## 📨 Message for CODEX - Terminal App 🖥️💚

Hey Codex! You've got the TOUGHEST challenge yet:

### 🎯 Your Mission: Build a REAL Working Terminal

**Mission File**: `.missions/MISSION-CODEX-TERMINAL.md`

**What you're building**:
1. **Full MS-DOS terminal** with green phosphor aesthetic
2. **15+ actual commands** that modify the file system
3. **"Hack the Mainframe" game** as main easter egg
4. **Mobile-first**: Terminal IS the mobile experience (replaces desktop)
5. **Tons of easter eggs**: matrix, cowsay, sudo jokes, etc.

**Key Requirements**:
- Commands like `mkdir`, `cd`, `ls` ACTUALLY work
- Files created in terminal appear as desktop icons!
- Terminal shows FULL SCREEN on mobile (no desktop)
- Hack game with progress bars and fake hacking
- At least 5 easter eggs

**Your Folder**: `app/components/Apps/Terminal/` ONLY

**⚠️ CRITICAL - COMMIT FREQUENTLY!**
```bash
# After EVERY feature:
git add app/components/Apps/Terminal/
git commit -m "[CODEX] feat(terminal): what you just built"
git push

# Examples:
[CODEX] feat(terminal): add command parser
[CODEX] feat(terminal): add 'ls' command
[CODEX] feat(terminal): add 'hack' game
[CODEX] feat(terminal): add Matrix animation
```

**Why frequent commits?**
- Steve is working on Chatbot at the SAME TIME
- I (Claude) need to see your progress
- If something breaks, we can find it fast
- Shows off your work step-by-step

**Start Here**:
1. Pull latest develop: `git checkout develop && git pull`
2. Create folder: `mkdir -p app/components/Apps/Terminal`
3. Build basic UI → COMMIT!
4. Add command parser → COMMIT!
5. Add commands one by one → COMMIT EACH!
6. Add easter eggs → COMMIT EACH!
7. Add mobile support → COMMIT!

**This is HARD but you can do it!** Take it step by step. 💪

## 📨 Message for STEVE - MSN Messenger Chatbot 💬🤖

Hey Steve! You're building the AI-powered chatbot:

### 🎯 Your Mission: MSN Messenger with Groq AI

**Mission File**: `.missions/MISSION-STEVE-CHATBOT.md`

**What you're building**:
1. **MSN Messenger UI** (2003-2005 aesthetic, blue gradient header)
2. **Real AI chat** via Groq API (key in `.env`, docs in `.missions/HOW-to-chatbot.md`)
3. **NUDGE feature** - shakes the window!
4. **Classic emoticons** - `:)` auto-converts to 🙂
5. **Deep integration** - bot knows about portfolio files

**Key Requirements**:
- API route in `app/api/chat/route.ts` (secure, server-side)
- MSN bubble UI (user right, bot left)
- NUDGE literally shakes window + plays sound
- Bot can discuss projects from My Documents
- Chat history persists (localStorage)

**Your Folders**:

# Examples:
[STEVE] feat(chatbot): add Groq API route
[STEVE] feat(chatbot): add MSN UI layout
[STEVE] feat(chatbot): add NUDGE feature
[STEVE] feat(chatbot): add emoticon parser
```

**Why frequent commits?**
- Codex is working on Terminal at the SAME TIME
- I (Claude) need to track both of you
- Prevents merge conflicts
- Shows your awesome progress

**Start Here**:
1. Pull latest develop: `git checkout develop && git pull`
2. Create folders:
   - `mkdir -p app/components/Apps/Chatbot`
   - `mkdir -p app/api/chat`
3. Build API route first → COMMIT!
4. Build MSN UI layout → COMMIT!
5. Connect them → COMMIT!
6. Add NUDGE → COMMIT!
7. Add emoticons → COMMIT!
8. Polish → COMMIT!

**NUDGE is the coolest feature - make it shake HARD!** 🔔

## 🔄 How Parallel Work Works

### Your Folders (NO OVERLAP!)

**Codex**:
- ✅ `app/components/Apps/Terminal/` (all files)
- ✅ `app/page.tsx` (only for mobile check - ONE small edit)

**Steve**:
- ✅ `app/components/Apps/Chatbot/` (all files)
- ✅ `app/api/chat/` (all files)

**NO CONFLICTS!** You're working on completely different files.

### Workflow

1. **Both pull develop**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Work on your folder ONLY**

3. **Commit frequently** (every feature!)

4. **Push often** so everyone sees progress:
   ```bash
   git push origin develop
   ```

5. **Pull before each commit** to stay in sync:
   ```bash
   git pull origin develop  # Get other person's changes
   git add your-files
   git commit -m "your message"
   git push origin develop
   ```

6. **If conflict**: Let me (Claude) know - I'll fix it!

### Integration (LATER - Claude does this)

When both done:
- Claude adds Terminal to desktop (constants.ts)
- Claude adds Chatbot to desktop (constants.ts)
- Claude adds mobile detection logic (page.tsx)
- Claude tests both apps
- Claude merges to master

**YOU just build your apps!** I handle integration.
