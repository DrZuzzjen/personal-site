## USER FEEDBACK - BOOT SEQUENCE ðŸŽ‰

The user just tested your boot sequence and said:

## What's Next

Stand by - Codex is working on Phase 5 (Applications) in parallel on the same branch. Once they're done, we'll merge everything together.

You're free to take a break or wait for next assignment.
